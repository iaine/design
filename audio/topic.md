# Topic Model

The probability of topic models used for the thematic topic sonification. 

The models are a prediction that an event belongs to a topic. 

The sound is related to the percentage and could be linked to the model.

|**Verb** |**Frequency** | **Sample** |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Frequency | Set in Hertz or MIDI | |
| Volume | Default 0.5. Multiplied against probability |
| Duration | Set by the temporal needs. |
| Sample Rate || Default 1.0 Change based on probabilty|

A subset of this can be used to create a sonification of the percentages. A richer model using this can be developed, either using multiple tones or samples.
