This comes from experiments in 'glitching'. 

Take a digital object, such as a file, and open it to get the data from the file. Using this data, and an understanding of the protocol, one can then map it to another form. 

For example, one can take a JPG data file and convert the triplets per pixel into characters in Python using the [chr()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#chr) function. This includes control characters as well as the characters. 

Through such actions, the idea of the number becomes a reference to another thing, such as a letter (97 for a or 163 for Â£) or on a colour scale such as the Redness of the pixel, leading up to 255. 

The number is a pointer to a sign that can ony be determined by the context and the consideration of the context. 

It can also be used to think about the way that meaning that is given to the number. Through this, the materiality of the number now comes under question. This comes into sonification through the act of transcoding but also using transcoding as a pattern. It also goes to Manovich's notion of metamedium. The computer has a limited set of digits thatcan be used in coding. 

In music, 255 may be represented by the frequencies between B3 and C4.
