## Grammatisation

This set of designs are informed by Stiegler's concept of grammatisiation. 

The frst pattern is the URL. Here I htink of the URL shortener and how it can be used to think about the way that it controls the links. The shortener alters the language used in the url to describe it but also the protocols used to determine tit. 

The first pattern is the url itself, moving from the shortened to the real URL through the facade. This can br used to think about the political and economic entities involved in the creation of the url. 

The second pattern is the connection and redirection protocols to understadn how the concept of the network is described. It is described as the single network but ignores its translation. This internal translation can be used to collapse time and space.

### Languages

Hashtags can be used as the bordwer between mahcine and human languages and potentially networks.

### Devices

The device used to writ e the data is removed from the network. This focuses the act of writing onto the database and the database narrative. The device is likely to be created by another corporation, leading to epistemological questions about the device.
