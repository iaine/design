## Time

Sound is a temporal object. Computational processes also create time through their (re-)presentation of a cultural object.  

### Machine 

Media theory has a lot to say about time and computing role. 

One pattern is indexed time: the order set by the algorithm. 

### Logical

This time comes from the various time ontologies designed to support the calcualtions of time. 

### Human

Human's perceive time but we may also consider ideas and patterns, such as timelines or conversation. 

A challenge here is the language that is used about time. Time flies! Time drags... :(


## Fold

In a reply, there is a dual notion of time. 

In one section, the event doing the reply to the earlier event is a pointer to an earlier time. The pointer cannot be calculated in audio as the pointer cannot begin until it the second event happens. If this was calcaulted in reverse, then we can use it as a foreshadowing: where an event suggests that a future event. This may also be done using two tones but is not considered for longer term work. 

In the second, the second point of the reply pulls across the first point by 'gravity' to it and sonified them together. The gravity is made from the semantics of the reply. This pull is a form of branching. 

In the final one, the reply is viewed as a fold in time, such as a joint rememberance of an event. The two points are sonifed at the same time but there is a fold sound that suggests the collaps ein time. It would be use with phrases such as "I remember". It might be considered the 'madeleine'. 

These pattersn can be used with other layers such as uncertainty or precision for the semantic meaning. These patterns move away from the grammar of action of the reply to consider its actions in time. 

Time here is not the main entity but it is a central part of the experience. 

## Moveable ticks

Considering the annotations, we can think about how thy might alter perceptoins of time. In a quantitative sound, the time might be binned so that each unit is equal. Howver, if we enjoy soething it might go faster, else it might drag. 

Thinking of hte annotations, the agreement could be done by removing some time. If it starts with 1 second, the the next might be 0.95 seconds and so on until it hits 0.05. 

Dissensus may reverse this by adding 0.05s to te time and lengthening it. 

Together, these two control the sonification's timings. 

## Perspective

The time may be shifted and made polyrhythmic to represent the various perspectives.  

## Space/Time

One of the parts of the development of networks is the collapse of space into time. The type of medium also affects the time - for example a letter might take 4 days where a telegram takes 4 minutes.
