## Time

Sound is a temporal object. Computational processes also create time through their (re-)presentation of a cultural object.  

### Machine 

Media theory has a lot to say about time and computing role. 

One pattern is indexed time: the order set by the algorithm. 

### Logical

This time comes from the various time ontologies designed to support the calcualtions of time. 

### Human

Human's perceive time but we may also consider ideas and patterns, such as timelines or conversation. 

A challenge here is the language that is used about time. Time flies! Time drags... :(
