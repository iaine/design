## Networks

These patterns come from the algorhythmics site. 

The basic pattern is the two part beat. As networks run, there is a call and response within it but also there is a data rhythm that may be heard. 

This design creates an abstract view of the packet transfers in the update. 

There is a two part beat:
small packet -> larger packet -> break

The small packet is a response but the larger packet contains data. This may be an HTML page or streaming. 

The larger package might be mapped to volume to suggest this change in the state from the small packet. 

The duration of the beats is device and connection dependant in the observed data, as is the break between packets.
