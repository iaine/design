## Networks

These patterns come from the algorhythmics site. 

The basic pattern is the two part beat. As networks run, there is a call and response within it but also there is a data rhythm that may be heard. 

This design creates an abstract view of the packet transfers in the update. 

There is a two part beat:
small packet -> larger packet -> break

The small packet is a response but the larger packet contains data. This may be an HTML page or streaming. 

The larger package might be mapped to volume to suggest this change in the state from the small packet. 

The duration of the beats is device and connection dependant in the observed data, as is the break between packets.

### Internet of Things

Networks created by Internet of Things (IoT) devices may have different network patterns. 

Devices, when scanned, offer a response to the call. We might think of this as "call and response" with some sort of response. 

Some return data for purposes such as pairing with a phone or similar device. This can be sonified as a two part beat:

call -> response

The response may be a simple tone or it can be a tone that reflects the company or type of device, depending on the reading. 

Some devices have an address but refuse to give any information away for pairing or other purposes. 

We can sonify these with one sound to denote the call but silence from the device.

### Devices

Networks can be sonified to understand the devices that bring them into being. The devices can be used for either medium or social questions.

This section can be be used to allow sonification using the network type from above. 

source -> device

or 

source -> device -> organisation or type
