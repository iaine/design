## Edge

Here we use the edge as the representational form when thinking about communities. 

The main part are the two communities, or nodes, that are related. 

The initial aim is to show the communities are linked, so the edge really are the nodes. 

Edge -> node1, node2, time = ?, dur = ?, vol = ?

The basic version focuses on giving the edge a simple form of being sonified. 

The parameterisation is used to allow for multiple edges to be heard, such as chapter 6 with the machine and human rhythms. 

It can be combined with modularity to identify noise in the rhythm.
