## Location

Networks collapse time and space together. The optical fibre nature
of networks and thre desire for speed has collapsed networks into 
data locations.

I want to think about how we might begin to rethink the concept of place
in the network. This comes from the concept of the seamless interface and
its requirement to have various pieces of information shown. 

This provokes the question about using location between the user and the
place that the event happens. Using the Haversine calculations to understand the time between the locations. The time can be used to delay the sonification or to alter its volume. 

The points can simultaneously be used to visualise the distance.
