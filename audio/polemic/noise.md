# Noise

This experiment considers noise and drones for sonification. 

This reflects Russolo's Art of Noise (1913) and the noise of the machines. 

This work reflects the notion of the machine that allows the discourse to happen.

Noise 

|Annotation|Meaning|Type|
_________________________
|OK|Consensus|Sawtooth Wave, Frequency. Shorter note length the more there are behind it. |

|KO|Dissensus|Reuses OK but detunes it. Slows time down. |

|Q|Question| 1 second noise, white noise, 1 second noise. A record skipping. |

The type of time is important. It may be continuous, rather than discrete. The aim is to emphasise the human within the machine. 

The first part is to design the drone sounds and boxes. 

The drones will need to take a constant frequency across all boxes. 
The consensus takes the frequency and start time. If using a machine, pitch can be altered to suggest load.
The dissensus is the consensus frequency using detune. 
The question may either add noise or the frequency as a base for the arpeggio. 
The reference would add in harminic depth. 

It can be layered by using a search box to identify the events that match. 
The layer would echo the above but it would be at a different pitch also creating a separate rhythm. The background layer would be quieter or the base frequency could be a relation to the other frequency.
