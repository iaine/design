## Purpose and Principles

The design language echoes work taking a digital media approach to digital Humanities. It is rooted in philosophy as well but uses these to develop a language to be used in design experiments.  

The purpose of this experimental language is to critique the way that sound is suggested by both Apple and Google as a background medium, such as the notification made when an email arrives on a Mac or an ambient background, like the tunes in a Swift playground. 

This language is designed to consider both the human and the machine processes in a digital Humanities project. 

One exploration in this is to provide both templates made from the language and a language itself. This echoes the wider conversation of whether templates or language help. Olga Lialina, at Transmediale, argued that the introduction of templates in Wordpress led to a decline in the use of HTML as a direct language in hher work on Geocities. This echoes Jahnke's arguments about the use of design grammars in applying rote lessons. This argument appears in the software design patterns.

The follow up question is what is a template? Is it the component drawn from the language, or is it the next step up, such as placing the component into a higher level language? 

### Principles

This is experimental and iterative. The language is not just the end product but the language used to design the language. 

Work against the seamless interface (Coyne, 2011).

Explain the traces that might exist. We might use reflection on the form / patterns to suggest new forms. Reflection and metaprogramming are also used as a tactic. 

The language is theoretical and philosophical. It is a tool/technique that is a practical (to some degree) experiment in concepts taken from sonification, media theory, post-structuralism and critical theory. 

It may not work. An idea may be conceived but cannot be brought to a satisfying outcome. These things happen.

I am mindful of Carla Scaletti's comments at the 25th anniversary ICAD about the balance between algorithmic composition and sonification. This raises echoes about the relationship with New Media art. It is creative but we cannot lose sight of the sonification's purpose and definitions.
